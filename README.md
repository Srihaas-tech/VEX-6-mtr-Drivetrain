# VEX-6-mtr-Drivetrain
Hi
How are you doing?
I see that ONE person actually decided to open the README!
My name is Srihaas and I was the one that made this.
It would be a good idea to open this with the VEXcode Pro V5.
("This" means the 5 pieces of code)
But honestly, if you're a good coder, you can open with VS code.
Anyways, the Red- [etc.] it's the code all in one line, I think. Although, I never
opened it.
main.cpp is the main code with the competition template. It has
the pre-auton, auton, and use control.
there is the bang-bang control that I made. (with GPT, ofc)
but the main knocker outer is the robot-config.cpp.
It is what I have trouble with.
This is the auto-code that is put there once you add a 4 mtr drivetrain
with the controller stating that I want an arcade drive.
All I did was add one line adding the 5th and 6th motors wherever it mentions the drivetrain.
But for some reason, it is pivoting while turning
which means that one side is moving forward, while the other isn't moving at all.
I want a swing turn. That is when one side moves backward while the other moves forward.
I was following this video for the arcade drive.

when I do an arcade drive, it doesn't move at all...
But the tank drive works perfectly
Thanks for your help.
And thanks for opening this README for a bit of background.
