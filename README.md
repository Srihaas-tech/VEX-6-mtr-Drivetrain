# VEX-6-mtr-Drivetrain
Hi
How are you doing?
I see that ONE person actually decided to open the README
My name is Srihaas and I was the one that made this
It would be a good idea to open this with the VEXcode Pro V5
("This" means the 5 pieces of code)
But honestly, if you're a good coder, you can open with VS code
Anyways, the Red- [etc.] it the code all in one line me thinks although, I never
opened it
main.cpp is the main code with the competition templete. It has
the pre-auton, auton, and use control.
there is the bang-bang control that I made. (with GPT, ofc)
but the main knocker outer is the robot-config.cpp
it is what I have trouble with.
This is the auto-code that is put there once you add a 4 mtr drivetrain
with the controller stating that I want arcade drive
All I did is add one line adding the 5th and 6th motors wherever it mentions the drivetrain
But for some reason, it is pivoting while turning
which means that one side is moving forwards, while the other isn't moving at all
I want swing turn. That is when one side moves backwards while the other moves forwards.
I was following this video for arcade drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piBOl5yHJ_c&t=1573s
when I do arcade drive, it doesn't move at all...
But tank drive works perfectly
Thanks for you help
And thanks for opening this README for a bit of background
